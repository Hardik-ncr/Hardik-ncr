## 🚀 About Me

I’m a business professional and operations student currently pursuing my **PGDM in Marketing and Operations** at **NDIIT (New Delhi Institute for Information Technology)**. With a solid foundation in business administration, I bring a hands-on approach to learning through internships and real-world experience in **auditing, marketing, hospitality, and customer support**.

Certified in **mutual funds** and **equity derivatives**, I integrate academic learning with practical exposure, having worked with brands like **ITC**, **Bharat Futureminds (BJP)**, and **Oscar Medicare**.
